Compile:
Run 'make' in the same directory as the source code for both the server and the
client.

Run Time:
To run the server, you can either type in 'server &' or create a new screen, run
the server normally, and then detach normally.

To run the client, you have to enter in 'client <WORD>' otherwise you will get a
usage error from the program.

Notes:
I had to make some changes to the server files in order to make it function
correctly. This meant that I had to reimplement the stand-by for-loop to make it
quit after a pre-set amount of time had passed. This was listed in the spec for
this assignment.

I used a the string library to help work with the data from the shared memory
and from the argument parameter for the client. This made the code a lot more
simple and easy to manage... I had some issues with pushing data back up into
the shared memory area, however I fixed the problem by implenmenting the string
copy from the string.h library.
